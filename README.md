### Description

This script automatically generates a HTML file with the splash art of the current champion skin and name. The file is generated after champion select when the match starts loading.

I've originally built it as a pre game screen/scene for my stream, right before the game starts (prettier than the usual loading screen). You can simply embed the template.html file into OBS, Streamlabs or any other Streaming App.

If you know some basic HTML and CSS you can also easily adjust the template file to better fit your needs, e.g. font-name, -size, -color etc.

### What does the script do?

The script generates a HTML file that can be embed in any Streaming tool. Fits perfect as a pre game loading screen.

### Instructions

1. Make sure python is installed in your machine ([Download here)](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
2. Install the needed py extensions:
```sh
$ pip install requests colorama
```
3. Double click the main.bat file and the script will run until an error occurs or you quit the command line app. Or start the script via the command line:
```sh
$ python main.py
```

That's it!
